   I use super sampling to deal with the problem of aliasing. 
   You could change the value of "SAMPLING" to improve the quality of resulting image.
   
   I submit two groups of resulting images, one group are generated with SAMPLING = 1 and the other group of images are generated with SAMPLING = 3. 
   By comparison, we can easily find out that the second group have better quality.
